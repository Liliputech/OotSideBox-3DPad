OotSideBox-3DPad
================
Thanks to a sponsorship by the young startup <a href="www.ootsidebox.com">OotSideBox</a>,

I've gratefully put my hands on the very innovative 3D Touchless Pad.

This nifty device is a new type of user interface enabling touchless control thanks to a pair of electromagnetics fields.

Don't forget to rename the sketch folder from OotSideBox3DPad-master to OotSideBox3DPad to respect Processing's naming conventions.

Happy coding, wonderfull morning :)
