OotSideBox-3DPad
================
Thanks to a sponsorship by the young startup OotSideBox,

I've gratefully put my hands on the very innovative 3D Touchless Pad.

This nifty device is a new type of user interface enabling touchless control thanks to a pair of electromagnetics fields.

Result is shown here : http://youtu.be/i1QtBPCrZuM
